# RAG Chatbot with Evidence Highlighting Feature

## Overview
In this workshop, we will build a chatbox web application with RAG functionality along with an evidence highlighting feature directly on a PDF file. We will also explore the basics of large language models, the mechanism and principles of a RAG chatbox, and the algorithm for the evidence highlighting feature.

- **AWS Bedrock Integration**: Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet for intelligent responses
- **Document Processing**: Upload and index PDF documents for knowledge base
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB for efficient document retrieval
- **PDF Highlighting**: Automatic highlighting of relevant document sections
